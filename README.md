# GameDuino
Repository containing simple games designed for an Arduino shield "GameDuino". Hardware specs and designs for the shield are also included for duplication.

Important:
This Repository acts as a self-contained Arduino sketchbook. As such, for easiest use, switch the Arduino sketchbook location to the GameDuino folder.

To change the Arduino sketchbook location, open up the Arduino IDE. Under File->Preferences (or Ctrl + Comma), you can see the file path for the sketchbook location. change this to the GameDuino Directory. (It should look something like C:\Users\...\GameDuino if you're using a Windows Computer).
